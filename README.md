# Sleep Efficiency Analytics
## COGS 108 Winter 2023 Final Project 

### About the Project: 
- worked alongside 5 UCSD students to analyze relationship between subjects' demographics, living habits, and sleep patterns with sleep efficiency based on preexisting Sleep Efficiency Dataset 
- cleaned and performed **univariate and bivariate data analysis**, visualized data to identify noticeable trends of each variable 
- implemented **ordinary lease squares regression** method within statsmodels module to create linear models using sleep score to identity potential correlations

### Main Findings:
- more exercise and eariler medtime may have _positive correlation_ with one's quality of sleep 
- smoking and consuming more alcohol may have _negative correlation_ with one's quality of sleep
